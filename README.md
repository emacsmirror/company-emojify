## ‚ùì FAQ

#### üí´ How is this different from [company-emoji](https://github.com/dunn/company-emoji)?

`company-emoji` is more lightweight and does not require [emojify](https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify).
However, it does not support display with emoji images. `company-emoji` would work
on its own since it declares its emoji list in [company-emoji-list.el](https://github.com/dunn/company-emoji/blob/trunk/company-emoji-list.el).
This package reuses the code from `emojify` hence this would be a better
choice if you already have `emojify` installed.

#### üí´ How to add more emoji?

Unlike `company-emoji` has specify it's own emoji list. Since we rely on
package `emojify`, please consider contribute to the upstream.
